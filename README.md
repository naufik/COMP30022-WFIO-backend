# We'll Figure It Out - Backend

This is the IT Project backend for team We'll Figure It Out.

The Backend is responsible for the following aspects of the app:

- Communication with the database server.
- Obtaining and writing data from or into the database.
- Handling communications between two clients, real time or non-real time.
- Authenticating users and making sure that private data is not leaked or shared between multiple users.

## How To Use

This server has already been preinstalled in our server (is used by the
We'll Figure It Out "Don't Lose Your Way" application). Hence there is no
need to install the server on your own local computer.
